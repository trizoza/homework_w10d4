# Enumeration

Your task is to write your own functions which do the following built-in enumeration methods:

* `find()`
* `map()`
* `filter()`
* `some()`
* `every()`

Bonus points:

* `reduce()`
* Write your own `forEach()` function and use it in your other enumeration methods. (There is no test for this!)

You will be given start code and some tests ( `./specs/enumeration_specs.js` ) and all you have to do is make them pass!
